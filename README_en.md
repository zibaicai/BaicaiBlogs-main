## I. Quick Start Deployment

### 1. Environment Configuration

Before starting, please ensure your computer has the following runtime environments installed; otherwise, the program will not start properly:

* **Node.js** (v18.x or above recommended)
* **Package Manager** (npm)
* **Git** (for pulling code and version control)
* **Python** (v3.10 or above recommended; tested under v3.10)
* *Optional: Cloud storage/Image hosting service (detailed configuration instructions provided later)*

### 2. Blog Source Code Update

To easily keep up with the latest features, please use the updater to update the source code!
By using the updater, you no longer need to manually compare code, worry about pull conflicts, or fear that your articles and configuration files will be overwritten.

🛠️ Update Steps:

Step 1: Obtain the lossless updater (only required for the first time)

#### 1. Download the update.bat and update.py files from the project's root directory.

#### 2. Move the downloaded update.bat and update.py to the outermost root directory of your local blog project (i.e., alongside the my-blog-manager and XHBlogs folders).

As shown below:


#### 3. Double-click the update.bat file to update. If it crashes, please run the update.py file using CMD.

### 3. Quick Start

#### ① Startup Script

Once you have completed the environment configuration above, the basic preparation is done.
First, enter the `my-blog-manager` folder (**⚠️ Note: Do not rename this folder under any circumstances, or environment path resolution will fail!**)

Double-click to run the startup script in the folder:
`Start.bat`
The script will automatically detect and install the required dependencies. Once the environment configuration is complete, the program will launch the backend console.

#### ② Deploy Your Blog to Vercel

> **Tip**: This tutorial primarily demonstrates how to deploy the project to Vercel, as Vercel provides native support for the Next.js framework.
> **Prerequisite**: Please ensure Git is installed and you have a GitHub account. **Be sure to follow the upcoming steps in order!**

> **Please ensure you have completed the following operations**:
> **Step 1: Local Global Configuration**

Set username

`git config --global user.name "Your_GitHub_Username"`

Set email (must be the email associated with your GitHub)

`git config --global user.email "your_email_linked_to_github@example.com"`

> **Step 2: Initialize Local Repository**
> Enter your project folder and execute the following CMD commands: (the frontend deployment folder, which is XHBlogs here)

1. Initialize Git repository to generate the hidden .git folder
`git init`
2. Add all files to the staging area (note the period at the end)
`git add .`
3. Commit to the local repository and add a remark
`git commit -m "first commit"`

**1. Configure Local Physical Path**
Open the "Settings" page in the console.
The pulled source code contains two core folders: `XHBlogs-manager` and `XHBlogs`. Please specify the local physical path of `XHBlogs` in the console.

![查看详情](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427122453.png)

Vercel will assign you a free subdomain by default:

![分配域名](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427122553.png)

---

### Question 1: How do I bind my custom domain name?

**Answer:** Here is an example using a domain purchased from "Alibaba Cloud" (the operation logic for other providers like Tencent Cloud, Cloudflare, etc., is similar).

First, log in to the Alibaba Cloud console and enter the [Domain Name Management] page:

![域名管理](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427123636.png)

Click the [DNS Resolution] button on the right side of the corresponding domain:

![点击解析](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427123737.png)

Then return to Vercel, enter your project dashboard, and click **Settings** (or directly click the plus sign next to the domain name):

![点击加号](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427123156.png)

![进入设置](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427123838.png)

In the Domains tab, enter the domain you purchased (for example, mine is `xinghuisama.top`), and click **Add** to save:

After adding it, Vercel will provide the configuration parameters for the `A` record and `CNAME` record. Please add these parameters completely to your Alibaba Cloud DNS resolution settings:

![添加记录](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427124533.png)

> **Note**: When adding records, be sure to carefully check the record type and Value!

After configuration is complete, wait a few minutes (DNS propagation takes time), and click **Refresh** on the Vercel page to update the status.

![Refresh](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427124625.png)

Once the status shows as normal, you can access the blog via your custom domain name! (For example: `www.xinghuisama.top`).

---

## II. Update Settings and File Upload

To protect data safety, this console uses an **"Operation Staging Area"** mechanism. **Please pay special attention!** Many settings must be actively "Updated to Local" after modification to be truly saved. When this operation is required, there is usually a highlighted prompt at the top of the interface.

**Operation Example: Modifying Personal Profile**

![修改简介](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427125314.png)

After modifying the content, click **[Stage to Operation Queue]**:

![暂存队列](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427125430.png)

At this point, the top toolbox will prompt pending operations. You can undo at any time (clear all), or click **[Update Local]**.

> ⚠️ Note: After clicking "Update Local," the data is only saved in your local console environment.

If you want these modifications to take effect on the frontend blog page, you must continue by clicking **[Sync Blog]** (assuming the physical path of the frontend blog is configured correctly):

![同步Blog](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427125800.png)

The publishing and modification of all content, such as blog posts, moments, and talks, follow this process.

> **💡 Golden Rule**: Staging Queue -> Update Local -> Sync Blog

---

## III. How to Push Your Modifications to the Live Webpage?

When you have completed satisfactory creations or settings adjustments locally and want to publish them to the public network for everyone to see:

Please remember, after making any substantial modifications and clicking **[Sync Blog]**, open the synchronous deployment page in the console:

![打开同步](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427130216.png)

Confirm that the "Line B" address is correct, and click **[Sync Source Code Only]**.
Wait for GitHub Actions or Vercel to automatically capture the update. In a short time, you will see the latest content on the live page.

---

## IV. Image Hosting Configuration

To optimize the writing experience, the console integrates image hosting upload functionality. This guide uses "7bu Image Hosting" ([https://7bu.top]()) as a reference.
If you prefer using direct external links, the console also supports direct insertion of image URLs. If you want to connect other image hosting services that support standard APIs, you can attempt to do so.

**Configuration Process:**

![图床配置](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427124930.png)

After filling in the corresponding API Token and other information, you can click **[Send Probe to Test Token]** to verify in real-time whether the image hosting interface is functional.

---

## V. AI Cat Assistant Settings

The blog system has a built-in AI Cat Assistant (connected to the Gemini model by default). Users can also modify the source code to connect other large language models.

First, you need to apply for a Gemini API Key. After obtaining the API Key, configure it in the console as follows:

![猫猫设置](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427134211.png)

After setting the exclusive system prompt (personality) for the cat locally, we need to give the online environment the ability to call the AI. Please log in to Vercel:

![Vercel环境](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427134538.png)

Find `Environment Variables` in the project settings:

![搜索变量](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427134633.png)

Enter your blog project details:

![项目工程](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427134703.png)

Ensure the scope (environment) includes the online environment, and click **Add Environment Variables**:

![添加变量](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427135004.png)

Input your key:

* **Key** input: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
* **Value** input: Your actual API key

![输入API](picture/Pasted%20image%2020260427135044.png)

Click save. The next time you redeploy, the Cat Assistant will be active online.

## VI. Comment System Configuration

The comment system of this blog is based on GitHub Issues (Gitalk or similar solutions). You need to create a **Public** repository on GitHub specifically to store comments from visitors.

In the console's comment settings, enter your GitHub username and the name of this public repository:


**Next, configure OAuth authorization to allow visitors to log in and leave comments:**

1. Log in to GitHub, click on your profile picture in the top right corner, and go to **Settings**.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the left menu bar and click **Developer settings**.
3. Select **OAuth Apps** on the left, and click **New OAuth App** in the top right corner.

**Key Application Information Filling Guide:**

| Field Name | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| **Application name** | Custom name, e.g., `My-Blog-Comments` |
| **Homepage URL** | The **complete address of your blog's homepage** (e.g., `[https://www.xinghuisama.top](https://www.xinghuisama.top)`) |
| **Application description** | Optional |
| **Authorization callback URL** | **Core parameter**: Must be your blog domain. If debugging locally frequently, you can enter `http://localhost:3000` |

**Extract Core Keys:**

1. Submit registration (Register application).
2. You will see the **Client ID** on the redirected page, which is the first required piece of data.
3. Click **Generate a new client secret** below to generate the secret.
4. **🚨 Immediately copy and securely save this secret!** Due to security mechanisms, this secret will be permanently hidden once you leave this page.

Accurately enter this `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into the corresponding fields in the console, and save to activate the comment function.
